            St. Michael the Archangel Academy Makurdi, a beacon of educational
            excellence, has a remarkable history that began on September 10,
            2018. Founded by Mr. Mathew Ezenwaka and Mrs.Stella Ezenwaka, the
            school opened its doors with a population of 141 eager pupils,
            housed in 10 classrooms, and supported by a dedicated team of
            fourteen staff members.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.aboutText}>
            One of the school's earliest symbols of unity and pride was its
            anthem, a poetic masterpiece crafted by Miss Ezenwaka Augusta
            Amarachi. This anthem, not only rich in words but deeply resonant in
            meaning, was brought to life through the musical talents of Mr.
            Henry Amagen, creating a melody that has been sung with heartfelt
            enthusiasm by generations of students.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.aboutText}>
            As the sun rose on that memorable first day of resumption, one name
            etched itself into the annals of the school's history - Master
            Onubuiyi Miracle. With a backpack filled with dreams and a heart
            brimming with excitement, he became the very first pupil to arrive,
            setting a precedent for the curiosity, determination, and spirit of
            exploration that would become synonymous with St. Michael the
            Archangel Academy, Makurdi.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.aboutText}>
            From these humble beginnings, St. Michael the Archangel Academy
            Makurdi has flourished into a nurturing institution dedicated to
            academic excellence, character development, and a commitment to
            shaping future generations. The school's journey is a testament to
            the enduring vision of its founder and the unwavering dedication of
            its staff, students, and the broader community. As it continues to
            evolve and inspire, the school's history remains a source of pride
            and motivation for all who walk its hallowed halls.
